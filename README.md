# OpenVideoCam


## What is OpenVideoCam?
OpenVideoCam is an open source alternative to commercial AI automated sports cameras like Veo, Hudl, Spiideo, Pixellot and many others.

## What is an AI automated sports camera exactly?
AI automated sports cameras are cameras that use artificial intelligence software to track objects (ball, players, corner flags, etc..) in the field without the need for a camera man to be moving the camera manually.
All cameras that we are aware off in the market are provided with a required subscription, so you pay upfront for the camera and a monthly fee to be able to upload the games to the web, so you can watch the games later from any web browser.

## What is the difference from OpenVideoCam to other AI sports cameras in the market?
Commercial AI sports cameras in the market provide a single and simple solution where the camera records and processes the source video, uploads the results to a website where the end user can watch the game later. 
OpenVideoCam is windows application that can process games recorded with **any camera** and produce an final video with all the nice zooming and panning AI cameras do. 
Because OpenVideoCam is a software only solution, it requires a little more work from the user because you need to transfer the raw recorded video to the computer so OpenVideoCam can process it and then you need to upload it to YouTube, Vimeo or other web video streaming solutions to watch it anywhere or just watch in the computer.
Although users have more work to have the final video available on the WEB, OpenVideoCam ends up being super flexible because you “own” the process, so you can use any camera you have, store your video anywhere you want and the most important thing, **it is ALL FREE!** 

## It the output produced by OpenVideoCam as good as commercial AI sports cameras? 
Not yet, but anyone is welcome to help as it is a free software! On another hand, you do not need to buy an expensive camera nor pay a subscription to use it!
 
## What do I need to use OpenVideoCam?
OpenVideoCam requires a Windows computer with a NVIDIA graphics card. Please note that OpenVideoCam can be used in computers without NVIDIA cards, but the time needed to process a video is much longer.

## How long does it take for OpenVideoCam to process a 1-hour game?
It really depends on how powerful your computer and NVIDIA graphics card are, but in general it should take about 3 hours.

## How do I install OpenVideoCam?
For now you need to download the source code and compile it yourself, but soon we will upload installation packages, so you will be able to download it from the releases area on github

## How can I help improving OpenVCam?
Any help is welcome and there are different areas to work in! The first step is downloading the source code and familiarizing yourself with the codebase. The core video processing is written in C++ and heavily uses OpenCV and PyTorch frameworks. The UI is currently using C#.
